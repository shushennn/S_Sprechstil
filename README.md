# Speech Analysis

In this project, the famous speech of Martin Luther King is analysed. 
The speech was divided into segments and labeled with Speechanalyzer. 

For our analysis, we extract midlevel and lowlevel descriptors. We transcribe the speech from audio and extract text features as well. 
The project comprises the code from Prof. Reichel for extracting midlevel descriptors. 

We annotate the speech and create a large dataframe to compare different speeches in the seminar. At the end, we create some visualisations.
